The .ghcid file is configuration for https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid

Comments in .ghcid files work strangely. I can't figure out how to keep them from showing up in ghcid's output, so I'm keeping the real comments here instead.

The config instructs ghcid to compile the main bowtie package and runs its non-doctest tests.

--dirctory "bowtie" refers to the bowtie subdirectory, this is necessary for the tests to work.
--warnings allows tests to run even if there are warnings.

NOTE: Is there a way to provide test arguments (eg for when you only want to rerun a specific test)?
