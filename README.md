# About

Bowtie is a small programming language for educational use.

It's a subset of Haskell (in fact a subset of Elm!) with algebraic types, pattern matching, recursive 'let', parametric polymorphism, and not much else.

Bowtie is designed to support a WIP [book](http://lambdakit.com/), but it's at a higher level of concern than the language, so this is the only reference to it in this repo.
